    <h1>The Best Ever Chicken Nuggets</h1>
    <p>This fried chicken nuggets recipe has been in our family for years. The only problem is that there's never enough. It's great for parties too.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons garlic salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves-cut into small chunks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Heat 1 inch oil in a large skillet or saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir together flour, garlic salt, and pepper in a bowl. Dip chicken pieces into beaten eggs, then press each piece into flour mixture to coat well; shake off excess flour. Place coated chicken pieces onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink in the center.</li>
        <li>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
